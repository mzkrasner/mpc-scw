## ðŸ’» Getting Started

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a .env file with a SEED (this must be the same as the SEED in your .env file of /composeServer), as well as a JSONRPCPROVIDER. For example:

```bash
SEED='a6e782751d79e724c47380f1aad31f80df876c5cd94b11699e186d9bbc57fa38'
JSONRPCPROVIDER='https://polygon-mumbai.infura.io/v3/98b02479b1984bab836b21a5c6a15775'
```

3. Start your development server:

```bash
npm run start
```
